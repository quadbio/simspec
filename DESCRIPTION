Description: Similarity Spectrum, including both Reference Similarity Spectrum (RSS)
    and Cluster Similarity Spectrum (CSS), is a way of data representation for large
    sample genomic data, particularly single-cell RNA-seq data. It represents each
    sample by its normalized similarities to a group of external references (RSS) or
    sample clusters of the data (CSS). This representation shows strong resistence to
    noises and technical variation such as batch effect, therefore can be used for
    data integration of multiple data sets. It also allows projection of new data to
    the existing reference data set easily.
